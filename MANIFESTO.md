# The Soonaverse Manifesto

Soonaverse is a collaboration between dedicated professionals, skilled in navigating the constant tension between invention and production to find ways to create, build, and get things done. We have different backgrounds, skills, and experiences, but share a singular goal, a shared vision, a common mantra - together we can build the impossible.

Our current “impossible” is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">building a more equitable world through decentralization</span>. A world where centralized systems have NOT concentrated society’s influence, power and wealth into the hands of an infinitesimally small number of individuals and organizations.

Decentralization will enable us to avoid cronyism and chaos. Where we are, what we’ve done, and how we’re SEEN is based on merit not image, value not celebrity.

Like the DAOs we create, we believe that contributions should be judged without bias, blind to color, class, and creed, where every vote counts, where “we” is stronger than “me”, and organizations are equal and flat because that’s the way they should be.

We believe that privacy isn’t just a cloak, it's a shield, and an anonymous voice is still a voice. DAOs must have trust, they must have reputation for members to create meaningful connections, so when people gather they become makers not mobs.

Your voice matters and NO ONE should demand a fee for expressing your opinion, no one should force you to pay to exercise your right to vote, decentralization must be an enabler not a wall.

Our DAOs will bring the change the world needs, by spreading the power of every decision across 7.7 billion points of humanity, where everyone's an influencer, because everyone has influence.

Ask WHO we need. We’ll say, YOU.

Ask HOW can it be done. We’ll say, TOGETHER.

Ask WHERE it will happen. We’ll say, RIGHT BEFORE YOU EYES.

And then ask us WHEN. No, ask us WEN and we will say SOON, because THAT is always our answer.

## Our DAOs

### The Soonaverse

#### Founding Principles

1. "All Voting MUST be FREE and Securely ON-Chain"
2. “DAOs must have immutable TRUST and REPUTATION”
3. “An anonymous voice is STILL A VOICE and members must be HEARD”

#### Commitments

* The Soonaverse is committed to building the foundation for organizations that enable DAOs and embrace personal sovereignty - where every person and community has the power to vote, the power to choose.
* The Soonaverse will remove the “dysfunction from decentralization” and steer communities towards its better angels through trust and reputation.
* The Soonaverse prioritizes the will of DAOs and its communities by creating equitable systems of proposal management. We believe that members should make their case, give people their vote and let the best ideas win.
* We will always strive to be a place for experimentation and innovation, but not at the cost of our members.
* The Soonaverse will be built with the most reliable and advanced decentralization technologies available, once they are PROVEN to be safe.
* We will embrace transparency and honesty in our approaches, especially when it comes to transitioning from centralized to decentralized technologies.
* The SOON token is a means to govern the platform and is woven into the very fabric of the system. We avoid fees wherever possible, especially when it comes to voting.
* We will create tokenomics that keep the platform funded and thriving to support the ecosystem, our members, and the DAOs we are creating.
